# Ex Libris

Ex Libris is a virtual shelf for curating, organizing, and displaying your favorite books, utilizing both the [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/api) and [Bing Image Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/) APIs for a highly customizable user experience.

Using a Ruby on Rails backend and a [React frontend](https://github.com/cmaniscalchi/ex-libris-frontend), users are able to search and explore books by author, title, or similar works, save books to specified bookshelves, and select the specific cover art they would like to display.


Minimalist, intuitive, and streamlined by design, Ex Libris features extensive CRUD functionality, allowing the books themselves to shine, so you can celebrate your love of reading and enjoy exploring literature in a new, visual way.

The frontend repository for Ex Libris can be [found here](https://github.com/cmaniscalchi/ex-libris-frontend).
